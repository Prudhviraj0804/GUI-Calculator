GUI Calculator in Python
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) Calculator built entirely by me using Python and the tkinter library. This project was developed from scratch to demonstrate my skills in Python programming and GUI development. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and provides a clean, intuitive interface for users.

Features
Basic Operations:

Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/).

Clear Functionality:

A C button to clear the input field.

Equals Functionality:

Evaluates the expression and displays the result.

Error Handling:

Displays "Error" for invalid expressions (e.g., division by zero or invalid syntax).

User-Friendly Interface:

Buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point (.), and operations.

About the Project
This project was developed entirely by me as a way to practice and showcase my Python programming skills. I used the tkinter library to create the graphical interface and implemented all the logic for handling user input, performing calculations, and displaying results.

What I Learned:
How to create a GUI application using Python and tkinter.

Handling user input and updating the display dynamically.

Implementing error handling for invalid expressions.

Structuring code for readability and maintainability.

How to Run the Project
Prerequisites:

Python 3.x installed on your system.

No additional libraries are required as tkinter comes pre-installed with Python.

Usage:

Click the buttons to input numbers and operations.

Press = to evaluate the expression.

Use C to clear the input field.

Code Structure
calculator.py:

The main script containing the GUI implementation.

Uses tkinter for creating the window, buttons, and input field.

Handles button clicks, input updates, and expression evaluation.

Technologies Used
Python:

The core programming language used for this project.

tkinter:

The standard GUI library for Python, used to create the graphical interface.

Future Enhancements
Add support for advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square root, exponents, trigonometric functions).

Improve the UI design with custom themes and fonts.

Add keyboard support for input.


About Me
I am a passionate programmer who loves building projects from scratch. This GUI Calculator is one of my first projects, and I’m proud of how it turned out. I’m always looking to learn and improve my skills, so feel free to provide feedback or suggestions!
